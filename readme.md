Rauma PHP Framework
===================

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/rauma/badge/?version=latest)](http://rauma.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

A full-stack PHP framework. Rauma uses convention over configuration to provide an out-of-the-box framework. This means it is easy to setup but relatively inflexible (you have to use Mustache and Doctrine for example).

Limited documentation is available in the `docs` directory, or online via [Read the Docs](http://rauma.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
